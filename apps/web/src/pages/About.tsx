      <h2>Why TruePick exists</h2>
      <p>
        (Boilerplate) This section explains the problem of impulse buying and purchase regret.
      </p>

      <h3>The 智商税 (IQ tax) concept</h3>
      <p>
        (Boilerplate) The founding insight that some purchases are a tax on poor decision-making,
        and that an AI can help you stop paying it.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        (Boilerplate) Values-aligned, non-judgmental purchase guidance. Not a budgeting app,
        not a guilt machine.
      </p>

      <h3>Solo founder transparency</h3>
      <p>
        (Boilerplate) Who built this, why they care, and that this is a one-person operation.
        Honesty over corporate facade.
      </p>

      <h3>Future vision</h3>
      <p>(Boilerplate) Where TruePick is heading.</p>
