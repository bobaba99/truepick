## Completed Tasks

- [x] Rewrote core project docs to reflect actual implementation: `TECH_STACK.md`, `FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`, `BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`.
- [x] Updated product docs with concrete content and tables: `PRD.md` and `APP_FLOW.md`.
- [x] Updated `PRD.md`, `APP_FLOW.md` to reflect `feat/daily-limit` implementation (anonymous auth flow §3.0, daily cap enforcement §4.1, state table §6, API proxy architecture §7)
- [x] Implemented and lint-fixed major web flows in `apps/web`: Dashboard, Swipe, Profile, verdict detail modal, filters, and kinematics-related issues.
- [x] Added verdict algorithm option `llm_only` across UI/service/types/modal and DB schema constraint in initial migration.
- [x] Improved auth compatibility in `supabase/seed.sql` by making seed user creation auth-backed and cleaning orphan profile rows.
- [x] Fixed Profile empty-state alignment so verdict empty card aligns with purchase history cards.
- [x] Implement purchase import from email route/page — **Branch:** `feat/purchase-email-import-flow`
- [x] Tighten verdict evaluation path robustness and UX messaging for LLM failure/timeout cases — **Branch:** `fix/verdict-llm-timeout-handling`
- [x] Mobile viewing adaptation (swipeable queue cards, touch gestures, responsive layout) — **Branch:** `ui/mobile-adaptation`
- [x] Trimmed canonical docs: removed ~880 lines of redundant content from PRD.md, FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md, APP_FLOW.md
- [x] Populated CLAUDE.md with project intelligence (architecture, patterns, gotchas, commands)
- [x] Integrated freemium tier model into APP_FLOW.md and README.md from `freemium_features.md`
- [x] Implement share verdict capability (image export to social media) — **Branch:** `feat/verdict-share-capability`
- [x] Settings route with theme, locale, currency, hold duration — **Branch:** `feat/settings-route-user-preferences`
- [x] Install PostHog alongside GA4 with autocapture, session replay, feature flags — **Branch:** `feat/posthog-analytics`
- [x] **Daily limit enforcement + Paywall + Anonymous Auth + Tier 1 telemetry** — **Branch:** `feat/daily-limit`
  - DB: `tier` column on `users`, `waitlist` table
  - API: `checkDailyVerdictLimit` middleware (429 `daily_limit_reached`), `/api/waitlist` endpoint
  - Analytics: `trackVerdictRequested`, `trackVerdictDelivered`, `trackVerdictOverride`, `trackPaywallHit`, `trackPaywallConversionStarted`, `trackShareCardGenerated`; `is_anonymous` on PostHog identify; `bucketPrice` exported
  - `VerdictRow` type: `confidence_score` field added (DB column already existed)
  - App: `signInAnonymously` on first visit; `updateUser` for anonymous → permanent conversion; "Guest" header display
  - `PaywallModal` component with waitlist form and anonymous sign-up CTA
  - Dashboard: paywall modal wired, `verdict_override` event, `verdict_delivered` event
  - Profile: `verdict_override` event mirrored
  - VerdictShareModal: `share_card_generated` event
- [x] PaywallModal CSS — add styles for `.paywall-modal*` classes — **Branch:** `feat/paywall`
- [x] Add loading bar during evaluation/regeneration with generative loading words — **Branch:** `fix/[]`
- [x] Adapt for mobile web browser size and layout — **Branch:** `ui/mobile-adaptation`
- [x] Resend waitlist confirmation email — branded dark HTML email sent to user on signup; deduplication via `isDuplicate` flag — **Branch:** `feat/resend-waitlist`
- [x] Wire `verdicts_remaining` from API success response into Dashboard state and show counter UI — **Branch:** `feat/verdicts-remaining-counter`
- [x] Soft-delete verdicts — `deleted_at` column + migration; `deleteVerdict` now soft-deletes; daily limit count and history queries exclude soft-deleted rows — **Branch:** `feat/verdicts-remaining-counter`
- [x] Regeneration bypasses daily limit — `existingVerdictId` threaded from `handleVerdictRegenerate` through `evaluatePurchase` → `evaluateWithLlm` → request body; backend verifies ownership before skipping count — **Branch:** `feat/verdicts-remaining-counter`
- [x] Fluid typography system — replaced 40+ fixed `rem`/`px` font-size values with `clamp()`-based fluid sizes scaling 375px→1440px; removed redundant `@media(max-width:600px)` font-size overrides; added fluid rem anchor on `:root`; SI card classes left untouched — **Branch:** `ui/fluid-typography`

## Change Log

## Notes & Decisions
- Freemium model: free tier = 3 verdicts/day (enforced server-side). Anonymous users get the full verdict experience via `signInAnonymously`. Account conversion preserves user_id and verdict history.
- `user_tier` in `trackVerdictRequested` is hardcoded `'free'` until the API response includes real tier data.
- Highest-risk gap resolved: LLM calls now go through authenticated API proxy, not direct from frontend.
- `purchase_stats` table exists in schema but app still derives headline stats mostly from `swipes`; aggregation job remains pending.
- Chrome Extension and premium analytics are Phase 2/3 — not started until free tier web app shows returning user growth.
